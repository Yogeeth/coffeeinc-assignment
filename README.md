## Task - 1 : Simple Chatbot CLI with Ollama and Langchain

This is a command-line chatbot you can talk to using an Ollama model. It remembers what you say and can chat with you back.

### What it does:
- **Load a model:** Use `/load` to start the chatbot brain.
- **Chat:** Use `/chat` to talk to the bot.
- **See chat history:** Use `/memory` to look at past messages.
- **Clear memory:** Use `/reset` to forget everything and start fresh.
- **Help:** Use `/help` to see all commands.
- **Exit:** Use `/exit` to close the program.
- **Handles long chats:** It keeps chat history from getting too big so it doesnâ€™t break.

### How to use:
1. Run the program and say if Ollama is installed.
2. Use **`/load`** to load the chatbot model.
3. Use **`/chat`** to start talking.
4. Use commands like **`/memory`** or **`/reset`** while chatting.
5. Use **`/exit`** to stop.
